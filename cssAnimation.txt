transforms  : translaX(200px) will gradullay move div 200px with respect tto x axis
            for other transforms  property we have
                -translateY,X
                -RotateZ(360degree),X,Y
                -Scale(20px) it will increace the size of div initial to 20 px , for X ,Y Scale(X,Y)


transition : 2s , it defines how much time should it take to complete the transition 
                to give particular time for transition first we set name and then time for it 
            
            transition : transforms  2s , transform will take total of 2s


.sudo{

    transforms : translateX(0px);
    animation-name : name;
    animation-duration : 2s (this same as transtion timing but for animations)
    animation-fill-mode : forwards (defines where the div should after the compliation of animation)
    animtaio-delay : 2s (defines after what time delay the animation should start )
    animation-iteration-count : infinite (set count how much should animation take iteration for now it will make infinity loop)
    animation-direction : noraml,reverse (animation direction set )
    animtaion-timing-function : ease-in ease-in-out (show the motion of animation)
